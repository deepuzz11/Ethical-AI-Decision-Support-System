# Ethical AI Decision Support System for Education

## Project Overview

The Ethical AI Decision Support System aims to evaluate the ethical implications of AI algorithms used in educational settings, focusing on ensuring fairness in grading and student evaluation. This system will detect biases, promote transparency, and facilitate equitable educational outcomes through AI-driven decision-making processes.

## Objective

Develop a decision support system that evaluates the ethical implications of AI algorithms used in educational settings, particularly focusing on fairness in grading and student evaluation.

## Goals

1. Ensure transparency and explainability in AI-driven educational decisions.
2. Mitigate biases that may affect grading and student evaluation processes.
3. Promote equity and fairness in educational opportunities through data-driven insights.

## Steps and Components

### 1. Data Collection and Analysis

- **Data Collection**:
  Identify and gather educational datasets that include student performance metrics, demographic information, and grading outcomes.
  
- **Data Analysis**:
  Analyze datasets to uncover potential biases in grading and evaluation processes, considering factors like demographic disparities and historical data trends.

### 2. Fairness Metrics and Evaluation

- **Implement Fairness Metrics**:
  Introduce metrics such as disparate impact analysis, demographic parity, and equalized odds tailored to educational contexts.
  
- **Model Evaluation**:
  Assess AI models against fairness metrics to identify and quantify biases in grading and evaluation practices across diverse student groups.

### 3. Bias Detection and Mitigation

- **Bias Detection**:
  Develop algorithms to detect biases in AI models used for grading and student evaluation.
  
- **Bias Mitigation**:
  Apply techniques such as data preprocessing and model adjustments to mitigate biases and promote fair educational outcomes.

### 4. Explainability and Transparency

- **Explainability Techniques**:
  Implement methods like LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to provide clear explanations of AI-driven grading decisions.
  
- **Stakeholder Explanations**:
  Ensure stakeholders, including educators and students, understand the rationale behind AI-generated decisions to enhance transparency and trust.

### 5. User Interface and Decision Support

- **UI Development**:
  Design an intuitive interface or dashboard for educators and administrators to interact with fairness evaluations, explore insights, and receive recommendations.
  
- **Features**:
  Include visualization of fairness metrics, comparisons of model performances across different demographic groups, and tools for exploring bias mitigation strategies.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Programming Languages**: Python (for data analysis, machine learning), JavaScript/HTML/CSS (for UI development).
  
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (for machine learning), IBM AI Fairness 360 (for fairness evaluation), Flask/Django (for web application development).
  
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation), SQL/NoSQL databases (for storing educational data securely).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Gather and preprocess educational datasets, ensuring compliance with student privacy regulations (e.g., FERPA) and ethical guidelines.
   
2. **Model Training**:
   - Train AI models (e.g., classifiers, regression models) on preprocessed datasets to simulate grading and evaluation.

3. **Fairness Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate models using fairness metrics to ensure equitable outcomes for all students.

4. **Bias Detection and Mitigation**:
   - Implement algorithms to detect and mitigate biases in grading and evaluation processes.

5. **Explainability Integration**:
   - Incorporate explainability techniques to provide clear insights into AI-driven decisions.

6. **UI Development**:
   - Design and develop an interactive UI for stakeholders to visualize fairness metrics and receive recommendations.

7. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Test the system rigorously using diverse datasets to validate fairness and effectiveness.

8. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the decision support system on a web server or cloud platform for accessibility and usability.
